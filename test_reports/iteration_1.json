  "summary": "Completed comprehensive testing of HEIC file converter application. Backend API endpoints are functional with proper validation and error handling. Frontend UI is well-designed and responsive with working file upload, drag-and-drop, format selection, and reset functionality. Backend-frontend integration works correctly, though actual HEIC conversion requires real HEIC files for full validation.",
