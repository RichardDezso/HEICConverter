One of the coolest things about HEIC files is that they allow you to keep high-quality images while using less storage space. This means you can snap away without worrying too much about filling up your device's memory. The pictures still look amazing, so you won't miss out on quality!"

Not all computers or software support this format, which can make it tricky if you want to send those beautiful photos to someone who doesn't have an Apple device. Sometimes you might need to convert HEIC files to a more common format, like JPEG or PDF, before sharing them, which adds an extra step."
